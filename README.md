Neural Network with Amharic Character recognition

## Documentation link
> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1saobVw2G75UqF-FTwtsgt7LiBpAKKDFZp9ujw_CGQLY/

## Contents
> Data collection folder used to collect data

> the NeuralNetwork.ipynb file illustrates all the neural network and how to use it on iris dataset

> Next to the trial of Neural Network with iris the actual data collected from a mouse pad is used as an input

### Progress
> works but with low accuracy
* figure out wheather the accuracy deprivation is because of an error in the NN or dataset
