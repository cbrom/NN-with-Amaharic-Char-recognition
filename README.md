# NN-with-Amaharic-Char-recognition


Neural Network with Amharic Character recognition

## Contents
> Data collection folder used to collect data

> the NeuralNetwork.ipynb file illustrates all the neural network and how to use it on iris dataset

> Next to the trial of Neural Network with iris the actual data collected from a mouse pad is used as an input

### Progress
> Can not figure out why its accuracy is greater than zero
* Next test using images instead of trace point values
